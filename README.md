Hello!
This is my MVP project and I am trying to create an application called Sip Sense.

Sip Sense
The Sip Sense App is a web application that allows users to track and review different types of drinks they have tried.
Users can create an account, explore a variety of drinks, and share their personal reviews and ratings.

Features
User Registration and Authentication

Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
User authentication ensures secure access to the app's features.
Drink Catalog

The app provides a catalog of various drinks, including their names, liquor bases, and additional ingredients.
Users can browse and search for drinks they are interested in trying.
Drink Reviews and Ratings

Users can leave reviews and ratings for drinks they have tried.
Each review includes a rating (on a scale of 1 to 5) and an optional text description.
User Dashboard

Users have a personalized dashboard that displays their profile information, favorite drinks, and a history of their reviews.
